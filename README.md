# Beginner Cybersecurity Projects

Welcome to my collection of beginner-friendly cybersecurity projects!  
These small but practical exercises are part of my journey to build strong foundational skills in cybersecurity.

Each project focuses on core concepts like system security, encryption, and scripting. Helping me get hands-on experience while exploring real-world use cases.

## Projects Included

1. **Basic Firewall Setup**  
   Learn how to configure a simple firewall on Linux using `ufw` to manage and secure incoming/outgoing traffic.

2. **Password Strength Checker**  
   A Python script that analyzes password complexity and provides feedback on how to improve password security.

3. **Secure File Encryption Tool**  
   A Python tool that encrypts files using symmetric encryption (e.g., AES) to ensure data confidentiality.

## Why These Projects?

While simple, these projects help me:
- Practice foundational cybersecurity concepts
- Get comfortable with Linux and Python
- Explore tools and techniques used in real-world environments
- Build the habit of writing clean, functional code

## What’s Next?

As I continue learning, I’ll keep adding more small projects and improvements here.
